# MscFe690-QuantConnect

QuantConnect divides the strategy into separate projects, with each project typically having a main file, 'main.py,' for building strategies, and 'research.ipynb' for further exploratory data analysis (EDA) if needed.

This repo include 5 main project, bookmarked with prefix Capstone1 to Capstone5, represent 5 strategy that is included in the report

The strategy leverage on using QuantConnect Platform. While the data is stored on the platform, QuantConnect offer a feature to share backtest result.

In simplest form we already make our backtest readily available online and accessible to anyone

 In order to rerun replicate the production data, a registration is required.
 Then, an user can clone the algorithm in the capstone link and start running the notebook on the platform by him / herself.

 Alternatively or incase the notebook is not accessible in this case we can utilize this offline file:
To be able to run please follow this step 
 - Open a new project on QuantConnect (after registration)
 - Copy the content from main.py of desired project folder to main.py file on cloud workspace (quantconnect.com)
 - Hit backtest button
