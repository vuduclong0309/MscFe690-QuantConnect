Thus, uncorrelated assets allows you to find a portfolio that will, theoretically, be more diversified and resilient to extreme market events. We're testing this statement in real life scenario, while hypothesizing a portfolio with uncorrelated assets could be a consistent portfolio. In this example, we'll compare the performance of 5-least-correlated-asset portfolio (proposed) and 5-most-correlated-asset portfolio (benchmark), both equal weighting."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Import Libraries\n","Load the required assembly files and data types."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"csharp"}},"outputs":[],"source":["// We need to load assemblies at the start in their own cell\n","#load \"../Initialize.csx\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"csharp"}},"outputs":[],"source":["// Initialize Lean Engine.\n","#load \"../QuantConnect.csx\"\n","\n","using QuantConnect;\n","using QuantConnect.Data;\n","using QuantConnect.Data.Market;\n","using QuantConnect.Algorithm;\n","using QuantConnect.Research;\n","using System;\n","using System.Linq;\n","using Accord.Statistics;"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Get Historical Data\n","To begin, we retrieve historical data for researching."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"csharp"}},"outputs":[],"source":["// Instantiate a QuantBook\n","var qb = new QuantBook();\n","\n","// Select the desired tickers for research.\n","var assets = new List<string>() {\"SHY\", \"TLT\", \"SHV\", \"TLH\", \"EDV\", \"BIL\",\n","                              \"SPTL\", \"TBT\", \"TMF\", \"TMV\", \"TBF\", \"VGSH\", \"VGIT\",\n","                              \"VGLT\", \"SCHO\", \"SCHR\", \"SPTS\", \"GOVT\"};\n","\n","// Call the AddEquity method with the tickers, and their corresponding resolution.\n","foreach(var ticker in assets){\n","    qb.AddEquity(ticker, Resolution.Minute);\n","}\n","\n","// Call the History method with qb.Securities.Keys for all tickers, time argument(s), and resolution to request historical data for the symbol.\n","var history = qb.History(qb.Securities.Keys, new DateTime(2021, 1, 1), new DateTime(2021, 12, 31), Resolution.Daily);"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Preparing Data\n","We'll have to process our data to get their correlation and select the least related ones."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"csharp"}},"outputs":[],"source":["// Extract daily return for each Symbol from Slice data\n","var returns = new Dictionary<string, List<Double>>();\n","var last = new Dictionary<string, Double>();\n","foreach(var slice in history){\n","    foreach(var symbol in slice.Bars.Keys){\n","        if(!returns.ContainsKey(symbol)){\n","            returns.Add(symbol, new List<Double>());\n","            last.Add(symbol, (Double)slice.Bars[symbol].Close);\n","        }\n","        var change = (Double) ((Double)slice.Bars[symbol].Close - last[symbol])/last[symbol];\n","        last[symbol] = (Double)slice.Bars[symbol].Close;\n","        returns[symbol].Add(change);\n","    }    \n","}\n","\n","// Convert returns into 2-d array\n","double[,] ret = new double[returns.Values.ElementAt(0).Count - 1, assets.Count];\n","int k = 0;\n","foreach(var kvp in returns)\n","{\n","    var symbol = kvp.Key;\n","    for(int i=0; i < returns[symbol].Count - 1; i++)\n","    {\n","        ret[i, k] = returns[symbol][i + 1];\n","    }\n","    k++;\n","}\n","\n","// Write a function to obtain the least and most correlated 5 assets.\n","public Dictionary<string, Double> GetCorrelations(double[,] returns){\n","    // Get correlation matrix\n","    var corrMatrix = Measures.Correlation(ret);\n","    \n","    // Find the absolute sum correlation of the assets\n","    var correlations = new Dictionary<string, Double>();\n","    for(int i=0; i < corrMatrix.GetLength(0); i++)\n","    {\n","        var symbol = assets[i];\n","        if(!correlations.ContainsKey(symbol)){\n","            correlations.Add(symbol, 0);\n","        }\n","        for (int j=0; j < corrMatrix.GetLength(1); j++)\n","        {\n","            var value_ = corrMatrix[i, j];\n","            correlations[symbol] += value_ >= 0 ?
